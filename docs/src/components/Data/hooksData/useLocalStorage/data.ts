  description: `The useLocalStorage hook provides a convenient way to synchronize the state of a component with the data stored in local storage. It automatically reads the initial value from local storage when the component mounts and updates the local storage whenever the state changes. Additionally, it listens for changes in local storage made by other tabs or windows and keeps the component’s state up to date.
